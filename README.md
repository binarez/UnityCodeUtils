# Simple and small code utils for Unity.

## l.o.g.cs
Simple but original Unity log wrapper.

## SerializableDictionary
Do you need a SerializeField-able dictionnary? Use this dropin class that adds the serialization logic.

## RequiredType
I'm unsure where I picked this up and if it'S still useful, it'S an attribute class restricting types.
