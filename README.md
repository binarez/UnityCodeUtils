# Simple and small code utils for Unity.

## l.o.g.cs
Simple but original Unity log wrapper.

## SerializableDictionary
Do you need a SerializeField-able dictionnary? Use this dropin replacement class that adds the serialization logic. I copied it somewhere and made it simple by using LINQ. I'm not a C# programmer!

## RequiredType
I'm unsure where I picked this up and if it's still useful, it's an attribute class restricting types.
